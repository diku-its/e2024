# Course Description

This course is a general introduction to IT-security.

Make sure that you read all the following carefully.

## Expectation and preparation for ITS
A significant part of the course is build on material from CompSys. If you feel this material is a bit far away it is recommended to shortly recap this. The course book does include a short background on some (but not all) parts, however, if you want to have the full understanding, you need to consult the material from CompSys as needed.

## Assignments

There are 6 weekly assignments during the course. Assignments are posted on Mondays. See due dates in lectureplan. 

The assignments will be pass/fail; expect to have at least 66 % of an assignment correct to get a pass. It will be possible to re-handin one (and only one) assigment (1-4); deadline 23 Oct.

All assignments will be in groups up to 3 persons. That means that you can discuss related material and solutions with fellow students (outside the group), TAs and lectures (it is actually encouraged), but your group have to write up your own solution to the problems. You are under no circumstances allowed to share your written solutions with fellow students outside the group.

Note that all deadlines are Sundays at 16:00.

### Feedback
Short written feedback to assignments will be given by TAs on the course. It will be given before the following exercise session, where you have the possibility to discuss with your TA. Feedback will focus on what could be approved in the assignment. The feedback may thus be useful for later assignments or the re-handin. Feedback will not give a direct justification of the evaluation (pass/fail).

## Exam qualification

To qualify for the exam you are required to pass at least 5 of the 6 assignments.
