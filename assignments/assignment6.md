# Assignment 6

Due: see lecture plan

## Lab

This assignment is not a SEED lab.
    
Consider the file [auth.log.zip](auth.log.zip) given on the course web site. It contains the log of a SSH server that has come under attack. Analyse the file and try to determine what is going on and if the attack was successful or not. Briefly comment on how you would respond to the attack and make a short proposal for how to avoid, or reduce the effect of, similar attacks in the future.

Note: The file unzips to 1.1MB. Hint: In Bash, consider using a combination of command-line tools such as ``less``, ``wc``, ``cat``, ``grep``, ``sort`` and ``uniq`` to analyse the file.

Describe your observations in a short report.

## Short answer questions

1. Compare forensics to incident response. What are the key similarities and differences?

2. When a file is deleted, is it typically erased or not erased from the media?

3. In forensics, what is slack space?

4. In data privacy, what is the difference between data generalization and data randomization?
